# Predicting-Wind-Power
# Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Bokeh, Scikitlearn, Statsmodels

Objective:

Apply machine learning techniques in Python to forecast wind power production.

​

Technical Specs:

Cleaned and organized 44,000-row, 10-column dataset with Pandas.

Conducted exploratory data analysis and visualization for insights.

Employed feature selection and train/test split for modeling.

Utilized Scikit-learn and Statsmodels for multiple linear regression, yielding MAE of 0.14.

​

Motivation:

Harnessing data science principles to bolster sustainable energy production initiatives.
